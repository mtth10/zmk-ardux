# cgoates's zmk config

Includes the board definitions for my handwired boards and the keymaps I'm using on them.

1. dactyl-cc, a 68-key split keyboard with a keymap similar to the Kinesis Advantage 2
2. paintbrush-matrix, a one-handed 8-key [artsey.io](https://artsey.io) board
3. joycon, an attempt to create a two-thumbstick combo-heavy board
